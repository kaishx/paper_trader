# Paper Trading Algorithm

## This repository contains:

**Paper-Trader Code**: Interacts with the Alpaca API to simulate the trading while calculating the kalman beta and other metrics.

**Multi-Agent Controller**: Manages the paper-traders concurrently (seeking to run about 20-25 traders)

**Optimizer**: To optimize the entry parameters for "today's" trading session.
